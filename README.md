# advance_Keylogger
Please do not use this code for illegal or immoral purpose and keep it open source!

To compile it you need to enable C++11 standards and -mwindows flag

The Keylogger is able to capture all the keystrokes using system hooks. In addition to this, it is also able to put them into a file, encrypt the file and send the file via mail based on a timer.

This keylogger is capable of recording all the keyboard and mouse input! It can even record independent of the language settings because it logs the physical keys on the keyboard first. Next, by using an arbitrary keymap with human friendly names, it translates the machine keys to something that we can understand.
It also possesses mail sending capabilities so you can just schedule the logfile to be sent via mail, lets say every 12 hours. In addition to this, it will also keep the logfile encrypted. 
Therefore, we will create another program which will be able to decrypt the logfile on your end. (TO BE ADDED IN LATER STAGES)


Something of the headers is mentioned in sort-of-notes.txt file..
