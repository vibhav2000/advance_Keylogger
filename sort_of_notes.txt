1.Installing codeBlocks (using 5g wifi)
2. trying to create a header(.h) file and deleting it in codeblocks. What is does is, remove that .h file from codeblocks prject window but keep it there in Windows explorer. 
SO we gotta delete it there too.
3. We hide the keylogger window, by passing it...
	using 
#include<iostream>
#include<Windows.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    MSG Msg;

    while(GetMessage(&Msg, NULL, 0, 0))
    {
        TranslateMessage(&Msg);
        DispatchMessage(&Msg);

    }
    return 0;
}

.. what this does is, if i execute this above file from my explorer folder and i click to run it.. nothing happens. that means the program ran but the window didnt show/open..
i can also check it by going into tskmngr and checking in services for my prgram.


4. We will be using approx 7 headers..first we'll be getting a guard (sometimes called a macro guard, header guard or file guard, is a particular construct used to avoid the problem of double inclusion when dealing with the include directive)




IO.h - where will we store all the functions used in the input output operations like creating, finding, deleting etcc

Parallel code execution and Remote code execution && precise way of sending mail every 12 hours. contains thread library and chronos library.
communication btw 2 process is diff than comm btw 2 threads (share the same memory address)
chrono is a time library


Header to send mail directly from CPP: we use powershell script to send mail
and put it in our code

Heart of our keylogger is header:: KeybHook (we use hooks to record keystrokes)
